# Example .htpasswd file for HTTP Basic Authentication
# This file contains hashed passwords for nginx authentication
#
# To create entries, use the htpasswd command:
#   htpasswd -c .htpasswd username
#   (use -c only for the first user, then omit it for additional users)
#
# Or use online tools like: https://hostingcanada.org/htpasswd-generator/
#
# Default credentials (included in Docker image):
# Username: fiit
# Password: mips2024
#
# In production, you should:
# 1. Create a custom .htpasswd file with your own credentials
# 2. Mount it as a volume in docker-compose.yml:
#    volumes:
#      - ./custom.htpasswd:/etc/nginx/.htpasswd:ro
# 3. Or rebuild the Docker image with your credentials
#
# Format: username:encrypted_password
# Example entry (password: example123):
# user1:$apr1$ruca84Hq$HppQb1nXRKHGUvCWPvlAP0
